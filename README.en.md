## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10 / 11 64-bit**
- **Node.js 24 LTS**
- **npm 10+** (npm 11 recommended)
- **[Rust stable](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)** (required for building the screenshot helper from source)
- **[Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)**

When installing Visual Studio Build Tools, select:

- **Desktop development with C++**
- **MSVC v143**
- **Windows 10 / 11 SDK**

After installing Rust, it is recommended to confirm the MSVC toolchain:

```powershell
rustup default stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

> Feishu, WeChat iLink, `nut-js` keyboard/mouse automation, and the native screenshot feature depend on the Windows environment.
>
> If you install a packaged release directly, you do not need to install Rust or Visual Studio Build Tools.

### 1. Clone the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Playa-0v0/Cyrene-Agent.git
cd Cyrene-Agent
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

The first installation downloads Electron, Pixi.js, Live2D, and related dependencies. The time required depends on your network connection.

### 3. Command-line Entry

The project ships a `cyrene` command-line entry point for the first-time greeting, version checks, and launching the desktop app. From the project root:

```bash
npm run build:cli
npm link
```

You can then use `cyrene` from any directory:

```bash
cyrene            # First run shows the welcome banner; later runs stay quiet
cyrene hello      # Show the full welcome banner again
cyrene about      # Banner plus project metadata
cyrene version    # Print the version
cyrene --help     # List all subcommands
cyrene run        # Launch the desktop app from a project root (dev mode)
```

> The first-time greeting appears only once; the state is recorded in `~/.cyrene/state.json`. Subsequent default invocations print only `Cyrene Agent <version>` and `Ready.`. `cyrene run` is dev-only in v0.9 and requires a `package.json` in the current directory; the production `cyrene desktop` entry will arrive in 1.x.
>
> `npm run build` already includes `npm run build:cli`, so you do not need to run `build:cli` separately after building the project. However, `npm link` is still required to use the `cyrene` command from any directory.

### 4. Install BGE-M3 (Recommended)

Cyrene can chat normally without running a local large language model. However, installing the **BGE-M3 Embedding model** is recommended for the complete semantic-enhancement experience:

- Semantic sticker matching
- Scene tone enhancement
- Worldbook semantic retrieval
- RAG retrieval

[Download BGE-M3 from Releases](https://github.com/Playa-0v0/Cyrene-Agent/releases)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Not installing BGE-M3 does not affect basic chat. Features that depend on Embedding will be disabled or degraded automatically.

### 5. Music Feature (Optional)

The music tool is integrated via [Code-MonkeyZhang/cloud-music-mcp](https://github.com/Code-MonkeyZhang/cloud-music-mcp). To use the NetEase Cloud Music feature, install the following additional dependencies:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)** — A Python package manager that will automatically download Python and install all dependencies when the music tool is first used
- **[NetEase Cloud Music Desktop Client](https://music.163.com/)** — Required for music playback; the `orpheus://` protocol must be registered

> [!NOTE]
>
> The music feature is optional and does not affect chat or other core features. If `uv` is not installed, the music tool will be skipped automatically with a UI prompt.

### 6. Build and Start

When running from source for the first time, you need to build the Rust native screenshot helper:

```bash
npm run build:screenshot-helper
npm run build
npm start
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The native screenshot helper is not committed to the Git repository as an `.exe` file. You must run `npm run build:screenshot-helper` once after cloning.
>
> **Windows users** can also double-click `setup.bat` in the project root to install dependencies, build, and run `npm link`, then double-click `start.bat` to launch.

Development mode:

```bash
npm run build:screenshot-helper
npm run dev
```

After modifying the Rust screenshot helper code, re-run:

```bash
npm run build:screenshot-helper
```

Development mode starts the Electron main process, Preload compilation, the Vite renderer, and the Electron application together.

Changes to the main process automatically restart Electron, while renderer changes are applied through Vite HMR.

Building a distributable Windows version:

```bash
npm run package:win:dir
```

The packaging command automatically builds both the Electron application and the Rust screenshot helper.

## ❓ FAQ

### Local AI Models

### Does Cyrene Support Local LLMs and Other Third-Party Model Platforms?

Cyrene only provides basic generic compatibility and fault-tolerance handling for local models, custom endpoints, and third-party model platforms that are not listed in the compatibility matrix.

Because these endpoints have not been tested through the complete Work workflow:

- Stable operation is not guaranteed
- Structured Output and Function Calling support is not guaranteed
- Completion of the full Agent toolchain is not guaranteed
- Configuration guidance, compatibility troubleshooting, and error diagnosis are currently not provided

Unknown models, local models, and custom endpoints use the generic **Tier D** profile by default. Users must verify actual compatibility themselves.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Cyrene is currently developed independently by a single developer. Time, hardware, and API testing budgets are limited. At this stage, compatibility maintenance and technical support are only provided for the major model providers that have been explicitly adapted and verified. The testing scope may expand as the project develops.

The primary model providers currently covered include:

- Doubao Seed
- Kimi
- DeepSeek
- Qwen
- GLM
- MiMo
- MiniMax
- OpenAI
- Anthropic Claude

Verification status varies by provider and model. Refer to the project's compatibility matrix and benchmark report for authoritative details.

> BGE-M3, `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, and `bge-reranker-base` are local Embedding / Reranker enhancement models used by the project. They are not local large language models for chat.

### Are API Keys Secure?

> [!WARNING]
>
> The current version is not recommended for use on shared computers or in other untrusted environments.

Credentials for the LLM, separate vision model, ASR, TTS, and other third-party services are stored in the application's `<userData>/` directory:

- `<userData>/model-settings.json`: LLM and vision model configuration (plaintext)
- `<userData>/app-settings.json`: ASR, TTS, maps, search, email, and other configuration (plaintext)
- `<userData>/weixin/credentials.json`: WeChat iLink Bot credentials (plaintext)
- `<userData>/mcp-servers.json`: MCP Server configuration, including `env` environment variables (plaintext)
- `<userData>/channels-settings.json`: Feishu `appSecret` / `verificationToken` / `encryptKey` (`safeStorage` encrypted)
- `<userData>/music/netease/account.enc`: NetEase Cloud Music login cookie (`safeStorage` encrypted)

Most credentials are currently stored as plaintext local files and are primarily protected by operating-system permissions on the user data directory.

Feishu channel credentials and the NetEase Cloud Music login cookie are encrypted with Electron `safeStorage`:

- Windows: DPAPI
- macOS: Keychain
- Linux: libsecret
- If the system keyring is unavailable, the application falls back to a weaker local obfuscation method

Do not share or upload `<userData>/`, settings files, or log files. Do not synchronize them to a public cloud drive or commit them to a Git repository.

To clear credentials and application configuration, delete the following files and restart the application:

```text
<userData>/model-settings.json
<userData>/app-settings.json
<userData>/weixin/credentials.json
<userData>/mcp-servers.json
<userData>/channels-settings.json
<userData>/music/netease/account.enc
```

### Can It Run on macOS or Linux?

Cyrene currently targets and is primarily tested on **Windows 10 / 11**.

| Platform | Status | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| Windows 10 / 11 | ✅ Tested | Primary supported platform |
| macOS | ⚠️ Not fully verified | The Electron application may run, but transparent windows, mouse passthrough, and window layering may have compatibility issues |
| Linux | ⚠️ Not fully verified | Differences in desktop environments and system keyrings may affect some features |

The `game-bot` module uses the native `nut.js` dependency and has only been tested end to end on Windows.

When reporting a macOS or Linux compatibility problem, include the runtime environment, error logs, and reproduction steps in the GitHub Issue.

### What Should I Do About OOM or Excessive Memory Usage?

Try the following steps in order:

1. **Disable the Reranker**  
   Settings → Cyrene Settings → RAG / Document Import → set Reranker mode to `none`.

2. **Disable MCP Services You Are Not Using**  
   Browser automation services such as Playwright may start additional Chromium processes.

3. **Reduce Large RAG Documents**  
   Remove knowledge-base files that are not currently needed to reduce indexing and retrieval overhead.

4. **Close Unused Windows and Background Tasks**  
   Long-running tool tasks, voice services, and multiple conversations may continue consuming resources.

5. **Restart the Application**  
   This releases memory occupied by models, indexes, browser subprocesses, and long-running tasks.

The Embedding index uses a background Worker, batching, and caching to reduce peak memory usage during document import.

If OOM errors continue, use the Chrome DevTools Memory Profiler in development mode to capture a Heap Snapshot, then include the reproduction steps and relevant logs in the Issue.

#### ⚙️ CyreneHarness Core Loop

> `Work / Code / Daily` and any session mode that requires tool invocation runs on top of **CyreneHarness**.  
> Source: [`src/main/orchestrator/harness/cyrene-harness.ts`](./src/main/orchestrator/harness/cyrene-harness.ts)

CyreneHarness is the core Agent Loop of Cyrene Agent. It chains **model decisions, tool execution, side-effect accounting, and state recovery** into a continuous loop that is interruptible, recoverable, and replayable.

**Key design points:**

- **Continuous while + Function Calling loop** — Each round calls the LLM, dispatches the returned `toolCalls`, and lets the model end the turn when it returns no tool calls.
- **assistantMessage must be written back (v3 P0 blocker)** — Every assistant message is pushed into `messages` unconditionally after each LLM response. Skipping this step breaks the loop on the next round.
- **Exclusive Ask path** — `ask_user` / `confirm_uncertain_effect` are user-waiting built-in tools that monopolize the round: other co-round tools return `not_executed`, and the progress buffer is discarded before continuing.
- **Four-state outcome with uncertainEffect interception** — Tool results fall into `success / failure / unknown / not_executed`. When `unknown` is paired with `sideEffect === non_idempotent`, the side effect is recorded into `state.uncertainEffects` and `halted = true` blocks further automatic replays of the same dangerous call within the round.
- **Failure retry** — Failed tools decide whether to retry based on `classifyToolResultError` + `resolveSideEffect`; the `sleepWithJitter` backoff is interruptible via `AbortSignal`.
- **Mid-loop Compaction** — Each round checks the token budget and triggers an LLM-driven summary when over the threshold, preserving todos and confirmed results.
- **Signal-aware throughout** — Almost every `await` is wrapped with `raceWithSignal`; `signal.aborted` returns `cancelled()` (with `finalAnswer = ''` and **no `final_answer` event emitted**).
- **Per-round checkpoint** — `onCheckpoint` persists `messages + state + rounds` so execution can resume after a cross-process crash.

**Five terminal states:**

| Status | `terminated` | `terminateReason` | Trigger |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| ✅ success | `false` | `undefined` | Model ends the turn without invoking any tool |
| ⚪ cancelled | `true` | `cancelled` | `AbortSignal` fires (`finalAnswer = ''`) |
| 🟥 error | `true` | `error` | LLM throws or checkpoint fails |
| 🟧 max_rounds | `true` | `max_rounds` | `config.maxRounds` reached |
| 🟨 timeout | `true` | `timeout` | `config.totalTimeoutMs` exceeded |

**Main flow:**

![CyreneHarness main loop](./docs/image/harness.png)

*(① Init → ② Main loop → ③ LLM → ④ Tool dispatch → ⑤ State ledger → ⑥ Terminal settlement)*

The modes below are consumers of this loop:

#### 🛠️ Assisted Work (Work)

![Work mode preview](./docs/image/work.png)

- **Driven by CyreneHarness** — Each message enters the while loop in [CyreneHarness](./src/main/orchestrator/harness/cyrene-harness.ts): every round calls the LLM → writes back the assistant message → dispatches tools → writes back tool results → checks uncertain effects → continues or ends. Pre-processors (CITA context understanding, Action Gate permission filtering) run before the Harness entry; the Soul persona layer generates the reply text after the Harness exit.
- **Free tool chaining** — Web search, webpage reading, file R/W, document generation, and lifestyle tools can be combined on demand; the model picks the next tool without pre-orchestrated flows.
- **Side-effect accounting** — When a non-idempotent side effect (sending email, modifying a remote file, etc.) has an unknown result, it is recorded into `state.uncertainEffects` and blocks automatic replay of the same dangerous call within the round.
- **Failure retry and cancellation** — Tool failures retry based on error class and side-effect tier (with jittered backoff); `AbortSignal` can cancel at any time. Cancellation does not emit a "final reply" event to avoid misleading the user.
- **Recoverable checkpoint** — `messages + state + rounds` are serialized to disk every round, so execution can resume after a cross-process crash without losing context.
- **Persona and workflow coexist** — Cyrene's character-driven reply is preserved alongside tool calls; the reply text is generated by the Soul layer and is not overwritten by tool results.

#### 💻 Code Collaboration (Code)

![Code mode preview](./docs/image/code.png)

> [!WARNING]
>
> Code mode **does not yet include a built-in review / diff preview**. Once the Agent finishes editing a file, the change is written to disk immediately. It is recommended to open the bound directory in your preferred IDE or diff tool (VS Code, Cursor, JetBrains, SourceGit, etc.) so you can inspect and roll back any change at any time.
>
> Initializing Git is the safest fallback: after `git init && git add -A`, any change can be inspected with `git diff` and reverted with `git checkout -- .`.

- **Code-specific tools on top of Work** — Reuses the [CyreneHarness](./src/main/orchestrator/harness/cyrene-harness.ts) main loop and registers extra code-focused tools (read/write/edit, command execution, LSP queries, etc.); Action Gate filters unsafe calls before the Harness entry, and Execution Policy decides whether to require a second user confirmation.
- **Trusted workspace binding** — All read/write, command execution, and LSP queries must stay inside the user-bound directory; the model cannot pick or change the workspace, and out-of-scope access (including `..` and symlink escapes) is rejected outright.
- **Semantic code queries (LSP)** — Code mode can query definitions, references, hover details, symbols, and diagnostics inside the bound workspace without modifying files.
- **User-managed servers** — Cyrene provides an LSP client only. It never bundles, downloads, upgrades, or silently installs language servers.
- **Startup order** — Commands that are absolute paths are picked first, otherwise the workspace `node_modules/.bin` is searched, finally the system PATH is walked entry by entry (Windows also appends `.exe` / `.cmd` and other `PATHEXT` extensions).
- **Install and troubleshoot** — Install the server your language needs, such as `typescript-language-server`, `pyright-langserver`, `gopls`, `rust-analyzer`, `clangd`, `jdtls`, `OmniSharp`, `intelephense`, `ruby-lsp`, `kotlin-language-server`, `lua-language-server`, `vue-language-server`, `yaml-language-server`. Use `where pyright-langserver` on Windows or `which pyright-langserver` on macOS/Linux. A user may explicitly ask Cyrene to assist through existing permission-controlled installation tools.
- **Security boundary** — Language server processes are spawned with `stdio: "pipe"`, `shell: false`, and `cwd` forced to the bound workspace. The model cannot specify a command, server ID, or workspace root; `lspServerOverrides` only overrides command name / arguments / extensions of built-in services, and **does not accept arbitrary commands supplied by the model in chat**.
- **Built-in languages** — TypeScript / JavaScript / JSON, Python, Go, Rust, C / C++, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, Lua, Vue, and YAML (13 in total, see `src/main/lsp/server-catalog.ts`).
- **Process reuse and release** — A given `serverId`'s LSP process is reused within the same workspace to avoid repeated cold starts; all processes are released when the app exits.
- **Custom server command** — Configure `lspServerOverrides` in `general-settings.json` under the application data directory to override a built-in service's `command` / `args` / `extensions` / `initializationOptions`; the model cannot supply a launch command in chat. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "lspServerOverrides": [
      {
        "id": "python-pyright",
        "command": "basedpyright-langserver",
        "args": ["--stdio"]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

#### 📚 Learning Companion (Learn)

- **Obsidian Vault Workspace** — Binds a Vault as the learning workspace, using the `materials/`, `notes/`, `exercises/`, `templates/`, and `learn/progress.md` structure.
- **Built on RAG and personalized memory** — Learning materials are indexed through the [RAG knowledge base](#-rag-document-knowledge-base) for retrieval, while progress and preferences flow into the L2 long-term memory to stay continuous across sessions.
- **Accompanied Understanding** — Helps users understand materials through questions, breakdowns, analogies, and discussion rather than doing the learning for them.
- **Notes and Exercises** — Organizes concepts, generates exercises, and records reviews inside the Vault, automatically maintaining a learning-progress overview.
- **Respects the User's Pace** — Re-explains when the user is stuck, advances when the user is ready, and never scolds the user for wrong answers.

#### 📅 Daily Affairs (Daily)

- **Reuses the CyreneHarness main loop** — The default general-purpose tool session for everyday Q&A, information organization, and light tasks.
- **Flexible tool execution chain** — Uses the same Agent shell as Work mode and invokes search, file, lifestyle, and other tools as needed.
- **Workspace binding** — Requires binding a trusted directory as the context root; file operations and tool execution stay within that directory.
- **Legacy session compatibility** — Unclassified historical sessions default to Daily mode and bind to a migration workspace for smooth upgrades.

#### 📝 Rich Text and Code Rendering

- **L0 / L1 / L2 Layered Memory** — Separately manages core user profiles, recent state, and long-term experiences.
- **Memory Evidence Chain** — Memory entries retain their source and context to reduce unsupported profile inference.
- **Conflict Detection and Resolution** — Retrieves, scores, and semantically evaluates old and new memories to distinguish contextual differences, preference evolution, and direct conflict.
- **Self-Developed DMAE Worldbook** — Manages character knowledge and long-term interaction content through triggers, priority, intrinsic value, linked activation, and Active / Dormant / Archived states.
- **Relationship and Style Continuity** — Gradually develops user preferences, communication habits, and relationship context through long-term interaction.

#### 🔊 Voice Interaction

- **Multiple TTS Engines** — Supports Mossland, MiniMax, MiMo, GPT-SoVITS, and custom cloud-based speech services.
- **Real-Time ASR** — Uses Alibaba Cloud real-time speech recognition to convert microphone audio into conversation input.
- **Complete Voice Calls** — Continuous voice interaction through the `LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING` state flow.
- **VAD Silence Detection** — Automatically detects when the user has stopped speaking and triggers a response.

#### 🧰 Tool Ecosystem

Cyrene includes many built-in and extensible tools, primarily covering the following categories:

- **Documents and Office Work** — Generate Word, Excel, PDF, and Markdown documents.
- **Web Capabilities** — Web search, webpage reading, content extraction, and information organization.
- **File Processing** — Read, write, and browse local files, as well as interpret images.
- **Everyday Services** — Weather, maps, translation, currency conversion, bookkeeping, trip planning, and more.

- Runtime-state preview: Settings displays live previews of mood, status, and related text.
- Embedding hot switching: Automatically detects incompatible dimensions and clears outdated indexes.
- File watching and hot reload: Runtime reloading for Worldbook and other watched files through mechanisms such as `watchWorldbookFile`.

## 🧱 Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js 24 LTS + Electron 43 |
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| Build Tool | Vite 7 |
| UI Rendering | HTML / CSS + React 19 + Pixi.js 7 + Ant Design X + Chart.js |
| Live2D | `pixi-live2d-display` 0.5.0-beta + Cubism Core |
| Agent Main Loop | [CyreneHarness](./src/main/orchestrator/harness/cyrene-harness.ts) (while + Function Calling + streaming reasoning/tools) + Structured Output + Native Function Calling |
| Agent Event Protocol | AG-UI (`@ag-ui/core`, `@ag-ui/client`) — decoupled from the renderer through `RUN_STARTED / STEP_* / TEXT_MESSAGE_* / TOOL_CALL_* / RUN_FINISHED` and other events |
| Tool Dispatching | Self-developed `tool-dispatcher` + `side-effect-resolver` + `error-classifier` + `retry-policy` quartet, handling the four-state outcome (success / failure / unknown / not_executed) |
| Sandbox Execution (Windows) | `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (SRT) — untrusted commands run through `SandboxManager.wrapWithSandboxArgv`; falls back to direct `spawn` when not installed, with `workspace_mutation` commands still rejected |
| LSP Client | Self-developed `LspManager` + `vscode-jsonrpc` protocol; processes are reused by `serverId`, launched with `stdio: "pipe"` and `shell: false` |
| Tool Extensions | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (stdio / SSE / StreamableHTTP transports) |
| Memory and Retrieval | Embedding (`@xenova/transformers`) + BM25 + self-developed Cross-Encoder Reranker + self-developed indexing pipeline |
| Context Entry Scheduling | Self-developed DMAE V5.1 (keyword-hit recall + activation decay + reversible active/dormant/archived states) |
| Chinese Retrieval | `@node-rs/jieba` |
| Browser and Desktop Automation | Playwright + `@nut-tree-fork/nut-js` |
| Rich Text Rendering | `@ant-design/x-markdown` (Markdown / code highlighting / KaTeX math) |
| Voice and Media | TTS / ASR + `silk-wasm` |
| Native Screenshot Helper | Rust + DXGI Desktop Duplication / Direct2D / GDI + WIC PNG + NDJSON IPC |
| Self-Developed Core | CITA (context understanding), Action Gate (permission filtering), DMAE Worldbook, unified Structured Output Pipeline |
| External Channels | Feishu OpenAPI, WeChat iLink |
| Documents and Email | ExcelJS, docx, PDFKit, Nodemailer |
| Testing | Vitest 4 |
